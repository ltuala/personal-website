### Day 1 to 20: Python Basics
The first 20 days are all about getting familiar with Python syntax, data types, control flow (if-else, loops), functions, and basic error handling. 
It’s perfect for those with little to no programming experience.

By day 20, you'll be confident writing basic Python scripts and solving simple problems; you will also finish the todo app.

I have also explored the capability of hosting the web application on Streamlit. Here’s an example demonstrating its [implementation.](https://ltuala-learning-python-web-app1.streamlit.app/)
#### Some Learnings 
The Python Shell is a built-in tool that lets you write and run Python code one line at a time.
It’s a great place to test out small snippets of code.

:::note Python shell

Early in the course it often uses the Python Shell to demonstrate basic concepts. To open Python shell type this on your terminal:
```python
python
```
To exit the shell:
```python
exit()
```

### Day 21 to 26: Python Intermediate
In this portion you’ll explore: file handling (text, CSV, PDF) and more advanced use of functions and modules.

:::note sample streamlit app
Streamlit was further explored, this time a sample portfolio of your own was built.

See [sample streamlit app](https://ltuala-learning-python-app2-portfolio.streamlit.app/)
:::
Here is a sample output of automating a PDF page.

Automation of PDF creation was also explored by generating some sort of invoices.

### Day 27 to 28: APIs 
A brief introduction to working with APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).  
This portion tackles: how to fetch data from APIs using Python’s requests library and parsing JSON responses.
![News API](app5_output.png)
### Day 29 to 37: Data Analysis
APIs was further explored on this section by building small project using live data (e.g. weather apps)  
![Weather API](app6_output.png)
![Weather API](app7_output1.png)
![Weather API](app7_output2.png)
Also, this segment introduces you to Python’s data analysis stack on sentiment analysis.

### Day 38 to 39: Web Scraping 
This time you will work with website to extract information. This section includes:
- Navigating HTML
- Building scraper for example tour schedules

### Day 40 to 44: OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) 
Now you'll deep dive on scalable code, which introduces you to OOP concepts like:
- Classes and objects
- Inheritance  

In this portion of the course you'll explore building a Webcam Detection application.

### Day 45 to 49: SQL and GUI
Now will go to interactive portion. You’ll cover:
- Basics of SQL (SQLite is introduced)
- Python Integration with databases
- How to build GUIs with Tkinter

You'll create applications with UI (user interfaces) and persistent data storage.

### Day 50 to 57: Web Development
This portion focus on builing web application with the use of [**Flask**](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) and [**Django**](https://www.djangoproject.com/).
You'll learn how to set up routes, templates and forms.
And of course, how to deploy this simple web applications.
### Day 58 to 59: Data Science and Machine Learning
A brief introduction to machine learning and data science. Activities includes:
- Training basic models 
- Making predictions and interpreting results

In this portion [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/) tool was introduced. 
### Day 60: Publish a Python Package
You’ll learn how to structure a Python project and be able to upload it to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/).  
![Python Package](app20_output1.png)
Its a way to share your work to the community. It’s a satisfying way to wrap up the course.  
![Python Package](app20_output2.png)
As you can see above, you can see your project being installed as how you usually install Python libraries.
## Some Other Learnings
Beyond the structured content, the course also teaches you:
- Best practices in programming
- Version control using [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- Debugging strategies 

You’ll also get exposure to useful Python libraries and tools.

:::note virtual environment
In this course, you’ll build projects requiring different libraries and versions. 
To keep your projects clean and avoid conflicts between packages, the course encourages using a virtual environment for each app.

To create a virtual environment in your project directory, run:
```python
python -m venv .venv
```

See more details on [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

## Final Thoughts
Ardit Sulce's Python Mega Course is for beginner to intermediate Python developer.
This course is project-driven, meaning you’re always applying what you learn in real time.


:::caution Heads up

When your working on the portfolio app, you might find the available `png` material to be outdated so you might need to check out other `png` to better suit the projects.
