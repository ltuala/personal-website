# Greetings! Lyndon here...

![Me](personal-photo.png)  

I'm a consultant at [Thakral One](https://www.thakralone.com/).

Four years deep in the analytics trenches, able to play around with real-time marketing, constraint-solving, and data integration. 🧙🏻

Tinkering things is my passion. That's why I love programming in general as I'm able to tinker things and see the results right away. This website is my digital spellbook, where I log my learning adventures. Feel free to [reach out](mailto:lyndontuala@gmail.com) on anything that sparks your curiosity. ✨

P.S. I used LLM to create this message. 😝
